#CullaBox
CullaBox colourises Openbox and tint2 based on your current wallpaper. CullaBox requires the development packages of libX11 and libjpeg(-turbo) and Python Pillow.

Just run ./install.sh.

The CullaBox script is copied into ~/.local/bin so you may need to add this to your PATH depending on distro. Read the top of tint2rc for making your own colourised tint2 themes.
